# Quotes Page

This is a small project to practice React Router (react-router-dom). This is part of a course by [Academind](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). You can check out the website [here](https://react-http-20032.firebaseapp.com/quotes)

## Features

- Add a new quote by navigating to the 'Add New Quote' tab
- See a list of all current quotes (stored in firebase DB)
- Check out details of a quote including any comments that have been added
- Choose quote list sort method (ascending/descending order based on add date)

## Other information

This site is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). While their real-time database feature is nice, I would recommend Netlify instead for easier integration with github and custom domain names.
